# COVID-19_Detection_and_Experimentation_with_Models
Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning. Images in dataset were augmented as there were less number of images the dataset. Experimented the dataset on various pretrained models for 10 epochs each and Summarized the results of those experimentation using a bar graph.
